Project D - Development Progress Report
Date: February 23, 2026

1) Project Overview
Project D is a Python CLI application that manages A-Z key/value data and integrates with Google Sheets.
It uses a menu-driven interface and supports worksheet management, ABC data operations, and a multi-stage quiz flow with persistent quiz result logging.

2) Core Architecture
- Language/Runtime: Python
- App Pattern: LangGraph StateGraph workflow
- External Services:
  - Google Sheets (data persistence)
  - Google Maps scraping (data generation for Create ABC)
- UI Style: Centered terminal output with ANSI color formatting

3) Main Functional Areas Implemented

A. Worksheet Management (Menu Choices 1-4)
- List Worksheets
- Select Worksheet
- Delete Worksheet
- Rename Worksheet
- Startup logic auto-selects the first worksheet if none is configured.

B. ABC Data Operations (Menu Choices 5-8)
- Create ABC: Generates or overwrites A-Z rows in the selected worksheet.
- Read ABC: Displays stored values in grouped fixed-key format.
- Update ABC: Updates existing key/value pairs and saves directly.
- Delete ABC: Clears values while preserving keys; supports repeated deletion flow with updated remaining values after each delete.

C. Quiz System (Menu Choice 9)
Three-stage quiz flow:

1. Practice Mode
- Displays key/value pairs one at a time for review.
- No correct/incorrect grading in practice mode (to avoid answer-copy behavior).
- Blue section heading.

2. Main Quiz
- Randomized prompts from populated keys.
- Case-insensitive answer checking.
- Adaptive repetition logic: wrong answers increase required consecutive correct attempts.
- Consecutive incorrect review trigger included.
- Blue section heading.
- Text and prompts centered.

3. Final Quiz (Alphabetical Review)
- Requires correct answers in alphabetical order.
- Incorrect response restarts the final sequence.
- Blue section heading.
- Text and prompts centered.

Completion UX
- On successful completion, user sees a centered green completion message indicating:
  - quiz is finished
  - results are saved
  - results are viewable in Choice 10

D. Quiz Results Logging (Menu Choice 10)
- New Quiz Results menu option.
- On successful quiz completion, app stores:
  - Timestamp
  - Worksheet name
  - Status (Completed)
- Results are saved to a dedicated Quiz Results worksheet.
- Results viewer displays entries in reverse chronological order (newest first).

4) UI/UX Enhancements Completed
- Menu display improved with centered layout.
- Active Google Sheet and Worksheet values shown in yellow in the menu header.
- ANSI color coding used consistently (green/red/yellow/blue).
- Major flows clear the terminal between sections for separate screen feel.
- Quiz headings for all three sections are blue and prominent.

5) Persistence and Safety Behavior
- Google Sheets load/save flows improved to preserve intended in-session changes.
- Worksheet fallback behavior avoids failure when configured worksheet is missing.
- Dedicated quiz results worksheet separates result logs from normal ABC operations.

6) Repository / Delivery Status
- Changes have been committed and pushed to the remote repository.
- Working tree was clean at last verification.
- .env is not tracked in Git (not committed).

7) Current Feature Set Summary (Menu)
1. List Worksheets
2. Select Worksheet
3. Delete Worksheet
4. Rename Worksheet
5. Create ABC
6. Read ABC
7. Update ABC
8. Delete ABC
9. Quiz
10. Quiz Results

8) Outcome
Project D has progressed from a basic LangGraph CLI into a polished, user-friendly learning and data-management tool with:
- robust worksheet handling,
- full ABC CRUD workflows,
- structured learning quiz flow,
- persistent, timestamped quiz history.
